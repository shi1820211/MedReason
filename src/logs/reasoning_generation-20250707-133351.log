2025-07-07 13:42:08,124 - INFO - Reformated question: Chronic urethral obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia can lead to changes in the kidney parenchyma. This obstruction, caused by urinary calculi, prostatic hyperplasia, tumors, normal pregnancy, uterine prolapse, or functional disorders, results in hydronephrosis, which is characterized by dilatation of the renal pelvis and calculus, leading to progressive atrophy of the kidney due to obstruction of urine outflow.
