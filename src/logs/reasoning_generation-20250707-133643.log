2025-07-07 13:41:25,755 - INFO - Reformated question: Growth hormone has its effect on growth through the mediation of somatomedins (IGF). The growth is primarily mediated by increased deposition of cartilage (including chondroitin sulfate) and bone, with increased proliferation of chondrocytes and osteocytes.
